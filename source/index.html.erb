  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<p>Hello! I am Andr√©s, a web developer and software engineer from Honduras.</p>

<p>I focus mainly on back-end web development, using Ruby on Rails, Django and Python. I am also a Java programmer and serverless lover.</p>

<p>
  When I am not coding, I love to spend my time playing chess, guitar, weight training, learning languages, hiking, diving, exploring new places, planning my next adventure, learning new things and just trying to become better everyday.
