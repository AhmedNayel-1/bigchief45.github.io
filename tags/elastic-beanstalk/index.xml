      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having an issue the past few days with Django and Elastic Beanstalk in a production environment that was driving me nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the Elastic Beanstalk environment was in a permament Severe/Degraded state. The health monitoring was reporting that 100% of the requests to the load balancer where &lt;code&gt;4xx&lt;/code&gt; requests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://aalvarez.me/posts/setting-up-elastic-beanstalk-health-checks-with-django/eb_unhealthy_400_requests.png&#34; alt=&#34;Elastic Beanstalk 4xx requests&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue was probably caused by several reasons. In this post I will go over the reasons I think I was experiencing it, and how it was fixed in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
